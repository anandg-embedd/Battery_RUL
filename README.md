# Generalized Implementation of RNNs for Chaotic Time Series Prediction

The complete model has been created and coded without using any library or data pre-processing tool.
Main objective is the prediction of the henon chaotic time series in future.

#

bptt.m - Back Propagation Through Time

forward.m - Forward Propagation

dsigmoid.m , dtanh - Derivates of activation functions

sigmoid.m - sigmoid activation function

gradDes - Gradient descent
